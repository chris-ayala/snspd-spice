# nanowire-spice
Repository for SNSPD modeling software and examples

Note, you will have to install LTspice (available here: http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/)

You will have to move snspdWithPhotonPort.asy either into the home directory of every circuit you simulate,
or install as administrator in your LTspice sym directory which should look something like this:

C:\Program Files (x86)\LTC\LTspiceIV\lib\sym
